# Bootloader
This project is a basic operating system written from scratch using Assembly (for the bootloader) and C (for the kernel). The bootloader loads the kernel and shows simple output on the screen.

🛠️ Built and tested on Ubuntu using:

nasm for assembly

gcc and ld for compiling and linking

qemu for running the OS

🔧 Features:

Bootloader that prints a message

Simple kernel written in C

Runs in QEMU (no need for real hardware)
